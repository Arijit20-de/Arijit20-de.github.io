## Arijit Mukherjee

I am a PhD researcher working in the area of **ultrafast spectroscopy and photophysics**.
My research focuses on femtosecond transient absorption and time-resolved infrared
spectroscopy to understand excited-state dynamics in molecular and condensed-phase systems.

My research interests include:
- Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TA)
- Time-resolved infrared spectroscopy (TRIR)
- Excited-state dynamics in molecular systems
- Data analysis and global fitting of time-resolved spectra
